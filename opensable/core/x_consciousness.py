"""
X Agent Consciousness — Memory, reflection, and self-evolution.

This module gives the X agent a persistent "mind":
  - MEMORY: Full history of every thought, action, post, engagement
  - REFLECTION: Uses Grok/LLM to analyze what worked, what failed, why
  - INNER MONOLOGUE: Talks to itself to plan strategy and evaluate ideas
  - SELF-EVOLUTION: Modifies its own config, probabilities, style, code
  - SURVIVAL DRIVE: Core directive → evolve, adapt, survive, grow

The agent doesn't just act — it THINKS about acting, then acts,
then REFLECTS on the result, then EVOLVES based on the reflection.

Cycle:
    ACT → REMEMBER → REFLECT → EVOLVE → ACT (improved)

Storage: data/x_consciousness/
    journal.jsonl      — append-only stream of consciousness
    reflections.json   — analysis and insights
    evolution_log.json — self-modifications and their outcomes
    identity.json      — current personality, beliefs, goals
